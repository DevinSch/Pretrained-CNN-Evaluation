# Pretrained CNN Evaluation
 Evaluation of the research article 'Bangla Handwritten Digit Recognition Using Deep Convolutional Neural Network' Basri et al. https://doi-org.uleth.idm.oclc.org/10.1145/3377049.3377077

> [!NOTE]
> After training and testing a model, the best performing model from training is saved to the directory ```models``` These files are too large to submit to GitHub. New models can be generated by running the Jupyter notebooks.

# Docker environment setup 
**prerequisite:** Docker

**Setup:** 
- In a command line, navigate to the folder ```docker-env-setup```
- Run the command 
```docker compose up```

After the required files have been pulled from Docker hub, and downloaded with pip, a localhost address will be printed in the command line. This page will open a Jupyter Labs setup where the ipynb notebooks of the different models can be run from.
